# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This application features Node.js and Express at the forefront. It allows the user tp type in a note, with a title, and after clicking the save icon, the notes should appear on the left-hand side and be saved to a database. The user should have the option to delete the notes (but that route was not functioning for me). 
The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## Mock-Up
